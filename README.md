# AB Testing

## Project Overview
For this project I performed A/B tests on an e-commerce website. The goal is to understand and correctly interpret the results in order to advise the company if they should implement a new website or keep the old one. 

## Techniques and model used:

- Probability and Bayes Rule
- State Research question
- State Null and Alternative Hypothesis
- Simulate under null for 10,000 samples using Law of Large Numbers and binomial distribution method
- Stating confidence interval
- Calculating mean from null hypothesis and actual (observed) mean
- Using z-test and p-value model form `statsmodels.api` to interpret results
- Using logistic regression model to predict binary outcomes
